# Newsletter-App
Personalized newsletter app

It is a REST-API programmed to generate a quick response to the client, to prevent time-delay in huge task requests. This API uses Celery as a 
worker and Redis as a broker server to send mass emails asynchronously.

Tech stack used: Django(Web APP), Postgresql(Backend), Celery(Worker), Redis(Broker), AWS 
SES(email-service).
